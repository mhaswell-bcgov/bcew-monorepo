# WordPress Monorepo

This repository contains WordPress themes and plugins managed in a single Git monorepo. Goals include **shared tooling**, **consistent standards**, **maintainability**, and **preserved history** when importing legacy projects.

## Documentation

**Primary documentation (onboarding, architecture, CI/CD, releases, versioning):**

[https://bcgov.github.io/wordpress-monorepo/docs/](https://bcgov.github.io/wordpress-monorepo/docs/)

The site is built from the `docs/` folder with **VitePress** (see [Documentation site](docs/documentation-site.md)). Package-level docs live under `plugins/<slug>/docs/` and `themes/<slug>/docs/` and are synced into the site before build.

### Quick start

**Requirements:** Node.js (see `engines` in `package.json`), pnpm, PHP, Composer, Docker (for `wp-env`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bcgov/wordpress-monorepo.git
cd wordpress-monorepo
pnpm install
composer install
pnpm composer-install
pnpm build
```

**Docs locally:** `pnpm docs:dev`

**Run one project’s WordPress env:** from that project’s directory, `npx nx wp-env-start` (see the [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md) guide).

**Generators:** `npx nx generate monorepo-plugin:theme` or `npx nx generate monorepo-plugin:plugin`, then `pnpm install`. See [tools/monorepo-plugin/README.md](tools/monorepo-plugin/README.md).

**Release:** push tag `<nx-project-name>/v<semver>`; see [docs/release-and-deployment.md](docs/release-and-deployment.md) and [docs/versioning.md](docs/versioning.md).

## Monorepo scripts (summary)

Root `package.json` defines monorepo-wide commands. Common examples:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm build` | `nx run-many` → `build` on all projects that define it |
| `pnpm composer-install` | Composer install for all projects with the target |
| `pnpm lint` | JS, CSS, PHP, Markdown, and `package.json` lint |
| `pnpm wp-env-clean` | `wp-env clean` via Nx for applicable projects |

Full tables and target semantics live in the **[docs site](https://bcgov.github.io/wordpress-monorepo/docs/)** (architecture, shared tooling, CI/CD).
